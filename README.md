# Project Reflection

<blockquote>What was most challenging about cross-platform development?</blockquote>

<p>Understanding how to have cross-platform dependencies co-exist without causing issues. The SQLite incompatibility with web testing really threw me for a loop and set me back more than I expected. I don't 100% feel as though I was set up to be successful in that aspect but I also understand that not everything is going to be given to me like it was with this assignment. </p>

<blockquote>How did you handle the time constraint?</blockquote>

<p>I thought that my time management was going to be the least of my issues; however, all of the unforeseen issues that kept coming up really set me back and was quite frustrating. To be honest, by the end of the assignment, I was completely frustrated and never wanted to look at the application ever again. I know that I need to improve my management skills. I don't want to make excuses about it. I'm just not that satisfied with my performance on this assignment nor am I happy with how stressed out trying to get everything done made me. I get that it is all a part of the process and it will get easier over time. That's the key part: over time. Right now I'm just so eager to turn this thing in and forget about it for a while. </p>

<blockquote>What would you improve with more time?</blockquote>

<p>All of it. I would take more time to understand the code first and foremost. I felt rushed and I don't really feel proud or satisfied with this particular assignment due to the rush and lack of personalization that made it difficult for me to get fully engaged. My dark and light mode wasn't finished to my liking and I don't think I had the proper time to actually imprint what I was doing into memory. It was more or less a frantic dash to get it done.</p>

<blockquote>What surprised you about the development process?</blockquote>

<p>How many roadblocks I encountered along the way when things were working smoothly. The littlest thing will break the entire application and I discovered that I need to be way more hands on in the process of actually creating each of the files myself. Without that direct input, I get confused and 'lost in the sauce' so-to-speak a lot. I forget little things, silly things.</p>
